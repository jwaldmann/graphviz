Changes since 2009.5.1
======================

* Fixed a bug where the Show instance and read function for DotEdge
  had the from/to nodes the wrong way round.  This was not immediately
  noticed since the Graph -> DotGraph functions created them the wrong
  way round, so for those users who only used these this was not
  apparent.  Spotted by Neil Brown.

* Greatly improved Attribute usage: almost all attributes are now
  covered with allowed values.

* Extend DotGraph to include whether a graph is strict or not and if
  it has an ID.  Also move the directedGraph field.

* Make "Dot" refer to the actual dot command and DotArrow refer to the
  ArrowType (rather than DotCmd and Dot as before).

* Make the Data.GraphViz.ParserCombinators module available to end
  users again, but not re-exported by Data.GraphViz; it has a warning
  message up the top not to be used.  It is there purely for
  documentative purposes.

* Use extensible-exceptions so that base < 4 is once again supported.

Changes since 2008.9.20:
========================

* Support polyparse >= 1.1 (as opposed to < 1.3)

* Require base == 4.* (i.e. GHC 6.10.*) due to new exception handling.

* Include functions from Graphalyze-0.5 for running GraphViz commands,
  etc.

* Module re-organisation.

* The Data.GraphViz.ParserCombinators module is no longer available to
  end users.

* Improved Haddock documentation.

Changes since 2008.9.6
======================

* Differentiate between undirected and directed graphs (previously
  only directed graphs were supported).

* Clustering support was added.
